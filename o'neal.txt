Shaquille O'Neal
This semester in AP Trampoline Construction, we covered the history of trampolines, how trampolines have impacted the world, different trampoline building methods, ideal trampoline materials, and how to create creative trampolines. Students completed homework research assignments, hands-on in-class activities, and a final project including building a trampoline of their design.
Shaquille was never prepared for class. You weren't ready with the required materials and didn't arrive on time.
You have not completed most of the homework assignments. You constantly turn in incomplete assignments and often turn those in late. I'm happy to help if you want some study strategies. Your average homework score was 59.0 percent.
You were often an active participant in group discussions. You were normally contributing to peer work and worked well with your classmates.
You have struggled a little to communicate with me this semester. I am happy to offer support for you in this class and help you further understand the material, but I can't do anything for you unless you talk to me, whether after class, during office hours, or free block.
Your final project can best be described using these words: springy, unpredictable.
You almost completed building a trampoline for your final exam. I think you could have gotten there if there was more time. Your exam grade paired with your average homework grade has earned you a final grade of 64.0 percent.
Your final grade for the semester is D.
